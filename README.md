# **SQL Project - Music Store Data Analysis**

## **Project Overview**
This project analyzes data from a music store database to answer various business questions. The goal is to use SQL queries to derive insights about customers, purchases, artists, and music genres to aid business decision-making.

## **Key Insights and Queries**
The project is divided into three sections based on query complexity:

### **Easy**
1. Identify the **senior-most employee** based on job title.
2. Find the countries with the **most invoices**.
3. List the **top 3 invoices** by total value.
4. Determine the city with the **highest revenue** (ideal for hosting a promotional music festival).
5. Identify the **best customer** who has spent the most money.

### **Moderate**
1. List the **emails and names of Rock Music listeners**, ordered alphabetically.
2. Identify the **top 10 rock bands** by the number of tracks they've written.
3. Find tracks with a **song length longer than the average**, ordered by length.

### **Advanced**
1. Calculate how much each customer spent on each artist.
2. Determine the **most popular music genre** in each country.
3. Identify the customer who spent the **most money in each country**.

## **Project Files**
- **SQL Queries (music_store_analysis.sql):** Contains all the SQL queries for the questions.
- **Dataset (album2.csv):** Dummy data used for the analysis.
- **Question List (Music Store Analysis-Questions.pdf):** Document outlining the questions to be solved.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Database Management System:** SQLite / MySQL / PostgreSQL (compatible with all SQL engines).
- **Dataset:** Provided in `.csv` format for easy import.

## **How to Use This Project**
1. **Import the Dataset:**
   - Use your preferred database system to import the `album2.csv` dataset.
2. **Run SQL Queries:**
   - Execute the SQL queries from `music_store_analysis.sql` to answer the questions.
3. **Analyze the Output:**
